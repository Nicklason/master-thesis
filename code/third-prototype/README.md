# Third prototype

This prototype implements a peer to peer network using TLS for communication. Unicast, multicast, and broadcasting has been implemented. A custom encoding has also been implemented, which is based on Protobufs.

A HTTP API is used to control nodes. The docker compose manifest file generated by scripts in the `../graph` directory exposes the HTTP API of node 1 on host machine port 8080.

See `../graph` for how to set up this prototype.
